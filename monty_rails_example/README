= Monty Rails Example =

== Monty Integration ==

See config/environment.rb for a canned Monty ExperimentSet.

This has two concurrent Experiments that alter the <title> tag and the "Hello, World!" DOM Element class.

Both experiments use a global $request_id counter as inputs.

== How to ===

* Run "script/rails s"
* Browse http://localhost:3000/ repeatedly.
* Notice:
** the <title> tag changes 2/3 of the time.
** the "Hello, World!" color changes 1/2 of the time.
** the ETag header value is subject to the selected Possibilities to avoid cache fixation.
